First, letâ€™s create a function which will check if a number is palindrome.
Convert the number to an array of characters. For example 999 will become: ["9", "9", "9"];
Get the length of the array;
Loop through half the elements from the array;
If the i-th element is not equal t0 the len-1-i-th element (the last minus i-th element) it means that the number is not palindrome, so we return false. Else the loop continues until it terminates. Then we return true;
Now that we have this function we can move on to the next step which is looping through all the pairs of 3 digit numbers, multiplying them and checking if the result is palindrome.
