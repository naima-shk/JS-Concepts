  /*Basic and tricky questions 
1) What are the differences between null and undefined?
Answer : Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

//Null
var test1 = null;
console.log(test1);

//null is also an object. Interestingly, this was actually an error in the original JavaScript implementation:
console.log(typeof test1);
// object

{
  /* 
UNdefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.

var test2;
console.log(test2);
// undefined

  /* Summary 
   Here are the quick facts:
    null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
    undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
    null is an object. undefined is of type undefined.
    null !== undefined but null == undefined.

//QUESTION #2

{
  /* 
 2) What are the differences between == and ===?
 Answer: == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.
=== is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.

//QUESTION #3

{
  /* 
 3) How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?
ANSWER: Works when you have simple JSON-style objects without methods and DOM nodes inside:
 JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2)
 Objects are reference types so you canâ€™t just use === or == to compare 2 objects. One quick way to compare if 2 objects have the same key value, is using JSON.stringify. Another way is using Lodash isEqual function

//QUESTION 4
{
  /*
  4) As [] is true, [] == true should also be true. right?
   You are right about first part, [], empty array is an object and object is always truthy. Hence, if you use if([]){console.log('its true')} you will see the log.
However, special case about == (double equal) is that it will do some implicit coercion.
Since left and right side of the equality are two different types, JavaScript can't compare them directly . Hence, under the hood, JavaScript will convert them to compare. first right side of the equality will be cooereced to a number and number of true would be 1.
After that, JavaScript implementation will try to convert [] by usingtoPrimitive (of JavaScript implementation). since [].valueOf is not primitive will use toString and will get ""
Now you are comparing "" == 1 and still left and right is not same type. Hence left side will be converted again to a number and empty string will be 0.
Finally, they are of same type, you are comparing 0 === 1 which will be false.

//QUESTION 5
{
  /*
 5) How could you write a method on instance of a date which will give you next day?
      var myDate = new Date('Febrauary 20, 2020 07:30:00');
     myDate.nextDay = function(){
  var day = this.getDate();
  return day + 1;

myDate.nextDayName = function (){
  var day = this.getDay();
  day++;

    case 0:
      return 'Sunday';
    case 1:
      return 'Monday';
    case 2:
      return 'Tuesday';
    case 3:
      return 'Wednesday';
    case 4:
