1) What are the differences between null and undefined?

   Here are the quick facts:
    null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
    undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
    null is an object. undefined is of type undefined.
    null !== undefined but null == undefined.

//QUESTION #2

{
  /* 
 2) What are the differences between == and ===?
 Answer: == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.
=== is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.

//QUESTION #3

{
  /* 
 3) How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?
ANSWER: Works when you have simple JSON-style objects without methods and DOM nodes inside:
 JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2)
 Objects are reference types so you canâ€™t just use === or == to compare 2 objects. One quick way to compare if 2 objects have the same key value, is using JSON.stringify. Another way is using Lodash isEqual function

//QUESTION 4
{
  /*
  4) As [] is true, [] == true should also be true. right?
   You are right about first part, [], empty array is an object and object is always truthy. Hence, if you use if([]){console.log('its true')} you will see the log.
However, special case about == (double equal) is that it will do some implicit coercion.
Since left and right side of the equality are two different types, JavaScript can't compare them directly . Hence, under the hood, JavaScript will convert them to compare. first right side of the equality will be cooereced to a number and number of true would be 1.
After that, JavaScript implementation will try to convert [] by usingtoPrimitive (of JavaScript implementation). since [].valueOf is not primitive will use toString and will get ""
Now you are comparing "" == 1 and still left and right is not same type. Hence left side will be converted again to a number and empty string will be 0.
Finally, they are of same type, you are comparing 0 === 1 which will be false.

  {
    /*Explanation:
function declaration function a(){} is hoisted first and it behaves like var a = function () {};. Hence in local scope variable a is created.
If you have two variables with same name (one in global another in local), local variable always get precedence over global variable.
When you set a = 10;, you are setting the local variable a , not the global one. Hence, the value of global variable remain same and you get, 1 in the log. ref: js hoisting/scope
Extra: If you didnt have a function named as "a", you will see 10 in the log. */

//QUESTION 13
{
  /* 13) Look at the code below, you have a for loop if you have setTimeout inside it. If log the loop counter inside setTimeout, what will be logged?*/
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(i);
    }, 10);
  }

  /* Answer: The above will not output the numbers 0 through 9, but will simply print the number 10 ten times.

Explanation: The console log is inside the anonymous function of setTimeout and setTimeout is executed when current call stack is over. So, the loop finishes and before setTimeout get the chance to execute. However, anonymous functions keep a reference to i by creating a closure. Since, the loop is already finished, the value i has been set to 10. When setTimeout use the value of i by reference, it gets the value of i as 10. Hence, you see 10 ten times.

Solution: You can fix it by avoiding closure. Just create a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), it will create its own scope and you can pass i to the function. In that case i will be a local variable (will not refer to i in the closure) and value of the i in every loop will be preserved.*/
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(
      (function(i) {
        console.log(i);
      })(i),
      10
    );
  }

  //Alternative Solution: Look at the code below and use your brain (if any).

  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(console.log.bind(console, i), 10);
