1) What are the differences between null and undefined?
Answer : Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

//Null
var test1 = null;
console.log(test1);

//null is also an object. Interestingly, this was actually an error in the original JavaScript implementation:
console.log(typeof test1);
// object

{
  /* 
UNdefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.

  /* Summary 
   Here are the quick facts:
    null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
    undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
    null is an object. undefined is of type undefined.
    null !== undefined but null == undefined.

//QUESTION #2

{
  /* 
 2) What are the differences between == and ===?
 Answer: == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.
=== is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.

//QUESTION #3

{
  /* 
 3) How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?
ANSWER: Works when you have simple JSON-style objects without methods and DOM nodes inside:
 JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2)
 Objects are reference types so you canâ€™t just use === or == to compare 2 objects. One quick way to compare if 2 objects have the same key value, is using JSON.stringify. Another way is using Lodash isEqual function

//QUESTION 4
{
  /*
  4) As [] is true, [] == true should also be true. right?
   You are right about first part, [], empty array is an object and object is always truthy. Hence, if you use if([]){console.log('its true')} you will see the log.
However, special case about == (double equal) is that it will do some implicit coercion.
Since left and right side of the equality are two different types, JavaScript can't compare them directly . Hence, under the hood, JavaScript will convert them to compare. first right side of the equality will be cooereced to a number and number of true would be 1.
After that, JavaScript implementation will try to convert [] by usingtoPrimitive (of JavaScript implementation). since [].valueOf is not primitive will use toString and will get ""
Now you are comparing "" == 1 and still left and right is not same type. Hence left side will be converted again to a number and empty string will be 0.
Finally, they are of same type, you are comparing 0 === 1 which will be false.

  {
    /*Explanation:
function declaration function a(){} is hoisted first and it behaves like var a = function () {};. Hence in local scope variable a is created.
If you have two variables with same name (one in global another in local), local variable always get precedence over global variable.
When you set a = 10;, you are setting the local variable a , not the global one. Hence, the value of global variable remain same and you get, 1 in the log. ref: js hoisting/scope
Extra: If you didnt have a function named as "a", you will see 10 in the log. */
